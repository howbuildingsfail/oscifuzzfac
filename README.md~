# oscifuzzfac
Arduino-controlled fuzz factory with MIDI controlled LFOs


All spi trimmers are 10k - so we'll have slightly different settings to consider if you are copying settings from t'internet


#Notes / Testing

##Frequency

There are two 'bands' of frequency at the moment - the range is massive, but difficult to control precisely - we'd like to get a relationship between frequency and bpm at some point

##Waveshape

We have sin(0-31), saw(32-63), square(64-95) and triangle(96-127)


##Mag / Centre

There's no checking for bounds here, so if your combination of Centre and Mag strays outside the range 0-255, you'll get artefacts. Some people might like this, and it keeps the coding fast to leave out checking...

##Phase

Not sure how well this works yet, because it uses the mozzi `setStart` function - which might mean that the shape loops around to this set start point - changing the shape entirely...

###Comp

Tested with other pots to manual,  D=127, stab=gate=64. All works fine - good candidate for synthing!

###Drive,Gate, Stab

All work as notes above


###noteon settings

There are a couple of no
